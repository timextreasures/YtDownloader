<h3>DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Do whatever you want, just don't be a dick. Being a dick includes-but is not limited to-the following instances:
    <ol>
      <li>Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.</li>
      <li>Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.</li>
      <li>Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original works creator(s) a pint.</li>
  <li>Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.</li>
<ol>
